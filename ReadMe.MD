# To Do List App

## Overview
The **To Do List App** is a simple yet functional web application that helps users manage their tasks efficiently. This project showcases a clean and intuitive interface built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It allows users to:

- Add tasks to a to-do list.
- Delete tasks entered erroneously.
- Cross off tasks as completed.
- Clear all tasks from the list.

## Features
### 1. Add Items
Users can type a task into the input field and click the **Add** button to add the task to the list. Each task is displayed with a checkbox and a delete button.

### 2. Delete Items
Each task has a delete button that allows users to remove it from the list in case of an error or if it is no longer needed.

### 3. Cross Off Items
Tasks can be marked as completed by clicking the checkbox next to them. Completed tasks will be visually crossed off for clarity.

### 4. Clear Entire List
The **Clear List** button allows users to remove all tasks from the list at once.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For the structure of the app.
- **CSS**: For styling the app, making it responsive, and ensuring a visually appealing design.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the functionality of the app, including event handling and DOM manipulation.
